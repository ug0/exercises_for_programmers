# Exercise 41. Name Sorter

Alphabetizing the contents of a file, or sorting its contents,
is a great way to get comfortable manipulating a file in your program.

Create a program that reads in the following list of names:

Ling, Mai
Johnson, Jim
Zarnecki, Sabrina
Jones, Chris
Jones, Aaron
Swift, Geoffrey
Xiong, Fong

Read this program and sort the list alphabetically. Then print the
sorted list to a file that looks like the following example output.

## Example Output

Total of 7 names
-----------------
Ling, Mai
Johnson, Jim
Jones, Aaron
Jones, Chris
Swift, Geoffrey
Xiong, Fong
Zarnecki, Sabrina

## Constraints

- Donâ€™t hard-code the number of names.

## Challenges

- Implement this program by reading in the names from the user,
  one at a time, and printing out the sorted results to a file.
- Use the program to sort data from a large data set and see how well it performs.
- Implement this program in a functional programming language and compare the programs.
