# Exercise 40. Filtering Records

Sorting records is helpful, but sometimes you need to filter down the results
to find or display only what youâ€™re looking for.

create a program that lets a user locate all records that match the search
string by comparing the search string to the first or last name field.

## Example Output

Enter a search string:  Jac
Name                | Position          | Separation Date
--------------------|-------------------|----------------
Jacquelyn Jackson   | DBA               |
Jake Jacobson       | Programmer        |  |   |  

## Constraints

- Implement the data using an array of maps or an associative array.

## Challenges

- Make the search case insensitive.
- Add the option to search by position.
- Add the option to find all employees where their separation date is six months ago or more.
- Read in the data from a file.
