# Exercise 42. Parsing a Data File

Sometimes data comes in as a structured format that you have to break down and turn into records so you can process them. CSV, or comma-separated values, is a common stan- dard for doing this.

Construct a program that reads in the following data file:

Ling,Mai,55900
Johnson,Jim,56500
Jones,Aaron,46000
Jones,Chris,34500
Swift,Geoffrey,14200
Xiong,Fong,65000
Zarnecki,Sabrina,51500

Process the records and display the results formatted as a table, evenly spaced, as shown in the example output.

## Example Output

Last     First     Salary
-------------------------
Ling     Mai       55900
Johnson  Jim       56500
Jones    Aaron     46000
Jones    Chris     34500
Swift    Geoffrey  14200
Xiong    Fong      65000
Zarnecki Sabrina   51500

## Constraints

- Write your own code to parse the data. Donâ€™t use a CSV parser.
- Use spaces to align the columns.
- Make each column one space longer than the longest value in the column.

## Challenges

- Format the salary as currency with dollar signs and commas.
- Sort the results by salary from highest to lowest.
- Rework your program to use a CSV parsing library and compare the results.
