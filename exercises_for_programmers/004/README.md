# Exercise 4. Mad lib

Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words.
You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story,
creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb,
and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

## Example Output

Enter a noun: dog
Enter a verb: walk
Enter an adjective: blue
Enter an adverb: quickly
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

## Constraints

- Use a single output statement for this program.

- If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution, use it to build up the output.

## Challenges

- Add more inputs to the program to expand the story.
