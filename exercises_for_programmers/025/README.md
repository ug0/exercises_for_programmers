# Exercise 25. Password Strength Indicator

Functions help you abstract away complex operations, but they also help you build reusable components.

Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:

- A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.
- A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.
- A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.
- A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.

## Example Output

The password '12345' is a very weak password.
The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.
The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.
The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.

## Constraints

- Create a passwordValidator function that takes in the password as its
  argument and returns a value you can evaluate to determine the password strength.
  Do not have the function return a stringâ€”you may need to support multiple languages in the future.

- Use a single output statement.

## Challenges

- Create a GUI application or web application that displays graphical feedback
  as well as text feedback in real time. As someone enters a password,
  determine its strength and display the result.
