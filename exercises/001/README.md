# Exercise 1. Saying Hello

The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
So create a program that prompts for your name and prints
a greeting using your name.

## Example Output

What is your name? Brian

Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!

## Challenges

- Write a new version of the program without using any
variables.
- Write a version of the program that displays different
greetings for different people.
